                                University of Jaffna was established on 29 May 1999 as the 5th Faculty in the University
                                of Jaffna to conduct BCom and BBA degree programmes. FMSC was the 6th Faculty among the
                                Management Faculties of the State Universities in Sri Lanka. Accounting and Marketing
                                specialisations were offered under the BCom degree programme. The BBA degree programme
                                offered two specialisations: Financial

                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Management and Human Resource Management. These two-degree
                                programmes were offered in both Tamil and English mediums. Prof. M. Nadarajasundaram was
                                the founding Dean of the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce. The Faculty was
                                under his leadership until the year 2005. Prof. K. Thevarajah was elected as second Dean
                                and took over his duties from 2005 to 2011.

                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The Faculty was granted permission for restructuring from the
                                University Grant Commission (UGC) in November 2008. Under this restructuring, Faculty
                                was allowed to have a single degree programme, namely, Bachelor of Business
                                Administration (BBA) and step down the Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree programme. The
                                two Departments were bifurcated into four Departments: the Department of Accounting,
                                Financial Management, Human Resource Management, and Marketing. These four departments
                                offered Bachelor of Business Administration degrees in the respective specialisation
                                areas: Accounting, Financial Management, Human Resource Management and Marketing,
                                respectively. The FMSC was functioning in the central premises of the University of
                                Jaffna. The authorities decided to move the faculty to the new premises, and the land
                                was purchased in Kalasalai Road, Thirunelvely in 2005.

                            <p class="text-justify">The Students’ Union was formed in 1980 in the name of the Commerce
                                Students Union. Afterwards, it was renamed as “Commerce and Management Students Union”
                                in 1990 with the approval of the University Council held on 21 April 1990. Prof. S.
                                Rajaratnam and Mr. B. Balachchandran were the union’s founding patron and senior
                                treasurer, respectively. The students of the two separate departments (Department of
                                Management Studies and Department of Commerce) wished to form their own independent
                                student unions. This, in turn, gave rise to the formation of the Commerce Students Union
                                and Management Students Union in 1995. Mr. K. Thevarajah and Mr. K. K Arulvel served as
                                Patron and Senior Treasurer of the Commerce Students Union, respectively. Within the
                                Management Students’ Union, Mr. M. Nadarajasundaram and Mr. D. Jeyaraman assumed the
                                role of Patron and Senior Treasurer, respectively.

                            <p class="text-justify">A greater emphasis was placed on developing students’ soft skills
                                and creative mindsets through student union activities. In this context, union
                                publications have been a significant achievement for them. “Virutcham” is the magazine’s
                                name published by the Commerce Students Union. In 1982, the first edition of Virutcham
                                was released while the Management Student Union launched its’ maiden edition in the name
                                of “Management Focus” in 1995. Since 1999, the “Management and Commerce Student Union
                                (MCSU)” has been representing Students of Management Studies and Commerce. As of now,
                                there are two sub-unions under the MCSU umbrella: the Management Students Society and
                                the Commerce Students Society.

                                and Sports Week) has been celebrated by FMSC to encourage students to participate in
                                cultural and sports activities. MACOS week entails a diverse range of activities such as
                                debate, poem writing, essay writing, singing and dancing competitions in all three
                                languages take place in MACOS week. Indoor and outdoor games as well as and athletics
                                are also conducted for all batches in common. This lasts for a whole week and eventually

                            <h3>Faculty Restructuring
                            </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">In the year 2010, the academic programs of the FMSC were
                                restructured to enrich the management curricula and give a professional orientation to
                                enhance the employability of the graduates. Under the restructuring programme, four
                                departments viz Department of Accounting, Department of Financial Management, Department
                                of Human Resource Management and Department of Marketing were established and decided to
                                offer a single degree programme, Bachelor of Business Administration, with avenues for
                                specialisation under each department. Thus, the Bachelor of Commerce degree programme
                                was discontinued, and the Department of Commerce was not accommodated in the
                                restructured programme. The Bachelor of Business Administration program’s curriculum was
                                reviewed with this restructuring. The internship programme was introduced in 2011 as a
                                prominent component in the fourth year to fulfil the degree to enhance the students’
                                practical knowledge. After the restructuring, Prof.T.Velnampy, Mrs. R.Yogendrarajah,
                                Mrs.SMC.Aloysius Mahenthiran and Mr.E,Ratnam were appointed as heads of each respective
                                department, such as Accounting, Financial Management, Human Resource Management and
                                Marketing. The Bachelor of Business Management (BBM) degree programme was introduced as
                                an open and distance learning mode (as an online degree program) in Tamil medium for the
                                first time by the Faculty in 2011. This was a remarkable achievement in the history of
                                FMSC. In the same year, Prof. Vasanthy Arasaratnam, Vice-Chancellor, University of
                                Jaffna, laid the foundation stone for the new faculty building at Kalasalai premises.

                                Professor T. Velnampy was elected as the Dean of the Faculty in August 2011 and held
                                office for nine years. Under his deanship, initiatives to recommence the Bachelor of
                                Commerce degree programme were undertaken due to the request from the public and several
                                representations from various quarters. The University Grants Commission approved the
                                proposal to commence the Bachelor of Commerce in late 2011. Following that, the
                                Department of Commerce was reestablished in 2012 and Professor. K. Thevarajah was
                                appointed as the first Head of the department. A new building for the Department of
                                Commerce was built with the help of University Grants Commissions’
